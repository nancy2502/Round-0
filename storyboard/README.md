## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Calculation of power in AC circuit , and information about power factor and improvement of power 

### 1. Story Outline:

This experiment is based on the consumption of power, evaluating power factor and its improvement.  Students will be able to understand the experiments after seeing it visually using the concepts that they have learnt previously

The objective of the experiment is to study DSB/SSB amplitude modulation and determine its modulation factor.
### 2. Story:

Power factor and its improvement plays a very vital role in our day to day life. The power factor of an electrical power system is the ratio of real power absorbed by load and the apparent power flowing in the circuit . Real power is the product of voltage and current.

In  electric power system, a low power factor load draws more current than a  high power factor load of the same amount of useful power transferred. The high current increases the energy lost and require large wires and other equipments. As the cost of larger equipment and wasted energy, electrical appliances will usually charge a higher cost to costumer where a low power factor is used. Hence improvement of a power factor is needed.

Improvement in power factor will increase the power factor of a load, improving efficiency for the system to which it is attached. Linear load of low power factor is corrected by passive network of capacitors and inductors. The devices for power factor correction may be at  central substation, spread out over the system, or built into power consuming system.

             Power in a single-phase AC circuit with inductive load (by combining       
           Inductance and resistance) is given by:
                                         P = I2R    
                         Where P= power consumed by load in watt.
                                        R= resistance
                                        I= load current in amps.
                                         
              For the circuit consisting of wattmeter, voltameter and ammeter to 
             values of power consumed by the load, voltage across the load and
             current drawn by the load, the power factor can be calculated as:
                                          POWER FACTOR= COS Φ = P / V I      
                                     POWER FACTOR ANGLE OF LOAD:
                                          Φ= COS-1= P / V I
                                     Active power P = V I Cos Φ watts
                                          Reactive Power Q = V I Sin Φ VAR
                                          Apparent power S = √P2 + Q2
                                          Power Factor = P / S
               By adding capacitor in parallel with some of the reactive power is 
               supplied by the capacitor depending upon value of capacitance added
               in parallel with the load resulting in reduction in apparent power (S) 
               supplied by the source and hence power factor being 
                                           cos Φ = P / S  increases
               Resulting in improvement of power factor.
